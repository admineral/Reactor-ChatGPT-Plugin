## Project Overview

This project is an application that uses React, Express, Puppeteer, and OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate and screenshot code. It's designed to receive a user's desired feature or change for a React codebase and returns the updated code along with a screenshot of the rendered application.

Once the local server is running:

1. Navigate to https://chat.openai.com. 
2. In the Model drop down, select "Plugins" (note, if you don't see it there, you don't have access yet).
3. Select "Plugin store"
4. Select "Develop your own plugin"
5. Enter in `localhost:5003` since this is the URL the server is running on locally, then select "Find manifest file".

The plugin should now be installed and enabled! You can start with a question like "What is on my todo list" and then try adding something to it as well!
